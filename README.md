## Download
You can download the **Alpha** Release [here](https://github.com/fpvout/fpv_viewer_android/releases/download/v0.1.0/DigiView_0.1.0_ALPHA.apk)

## Instructions
App is still in development so it will probably crash / stop working at some point. to get the best result :
- Power on your googles.
- Power your drone.
- Wait for the link to be established
- Plug the USB cable on your phone
- Automatic launch is enabled so app should launch. if not, just launch app manually.
- Wait. you should see some images, then it freezes a few seconds and then video is SMOOOOOOOOOTHingly streaming

If there is any issue, please check on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/uGYMNByeTH), some people might help you there.

## Known Issues
- It is recommended you do not launch the app prior to plugging in, and to back out of app when done (not minimize). Currently this can result in multiple instances of the player.
- Concerning hardware, Usb-C to Usb-C cables sometimes don't work depending the phone you're using. in that case, USB OTG Adapters is the best option.
- You *may* need to Activate Usb OTG in your Android settings to get the fpv goggles detected.

## Development
 - We will put more info here in the near future.
